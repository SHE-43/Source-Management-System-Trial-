    #In an insertbox, as soon as an item longer than required link is entered should be taken in immediately. Like on YTD.
    # Have loading screen, when loading the project up from start.
    # Change of DOB to 3 text boxes that added the hyphen and make a dtobject for us or make a dt object that is today's date.
    # Create something like the dataentry viewer box.
    # Reset the file
    # Remove methodology
    # Have a password protected settings menu that has the option to change the font, overwrite font using a file that we have saved as JSON
    # Power to select cells to know which one goes where in the SQL mapping - WOW. Check this situation out
    # Try with simple text files first or excel
    # This should read a file in treeview and then make it make then values we select the ones that should be pasted.
    # This can then allow us to delete the excel file to build a new one.
            # More settings and views
            # File for saving it somewhere else - Using Json or pickle, we save the link of the new path somewhere if we can.
    # Fix the grid, placement and packing of all these rows and what not - make the format neat and clean - divide in methods and then further into modules. DIVIDE and make neat.
    # Make 2 tabs like that man did in video # https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J48tIufwmRI&t=69s
    # Save on multiple sheets different type of data- have a clever way of knowing where to save what type of data even if we are making a mistake here.
            # Making a sale, customer data, product details (Available and updated on a website)
    # Start with a smart window that asks what we want - view data of a sheet, update or add data. Other functions then do more and more.
    # Have option to clear the whole excel file or SQL database aswell.
    # Start making database for this and can we save to different relations
    # A tkinter interface that updates various relations of a database - could be excel
    # Fix the issue with exiting via cross
    # Add some windows to this window - like a file explorer from which we can get a file name, link or just look around
    # Add features like your calculator, or launch windows calculaotr
    # Writing notes that can be in a window that can be killed completely without saving anything
    # Have file edit and view buttons available as well
    # Add a very secure user registration for users to use - have access for managers and for simple access people - like you have in a SQL database
    # Add all of this on a server to be used as an exe and a SaaS online - this will take you to another level.
    # Have a website where managers can log in and then use this for updating stuff.
    # Have a portal for customers as well where they can make a purchase - The online store where we sell Online Tools.
    # Add pandas tricks to this same thing to do tricks with the data we are landing
    # Machine learning with colimns or the whole dataset.
    # Automatically clear and make an extra layer where this data gets added once you''ve press add so that we can have a view of the data we just added.
    # Your network must use TreeVIEW
    # Hardcore would be to make something like tkinter yourself that connects to the PC.
    # Use common modules stuff as well
    # Add to server or only launch from a deployable server that is created by Python
    # Learn more of these as well.
    # Arrange by date, name or dob, up or down in treeview.  SORTING OPTION UP AND DOWN
    # ADD DATETIME as well which adds current date time and then have sorting option too
    # This could be your Mintec project as well - Do not over do this,
    # Have geographical sales so that at the end we have a map of a graph that can be opened to see the number of sales made in each region
    # Make sure we can have a PYTZ usage as well
    # Have file edit view options to change various stuff
    # TEST it rigourously and apply basic datascience options like probability of sale in which region and when due to time of month.
    # Next month's sales - other pandasd and data analysis tricks applied
    # Should be neat and well tested - remove anything that causes errors
    # Sign in for multiple managers - view only mode as well.
    # Strong password protection
    # To exe please.
    # Later apply the network to it somehow - non project related
    # It is all connected baby.
    # Data scraping for names.
    # Or make it in Java.
    # Grab other ideas from idea lists in PC (prject ideas, iphone and samsung and others).
    # Make this deployable at first - have a way to ask whether this is launched for the 1st time but be clever if the other person is lying.
    # Tkinter tutorial for further knowledge.
    # At the end, attach the Java calulator with this.
